Teaching is a fulfilling, yet taxing career. I personally can attest to this, as I was once a high school math teacher. With long hours and a heavy workload, it is not difficult to fall victim to "teacher burnout". Psychology Today describes burnout as "a state of chronic stress that leads to physical and emotional exhaustion, cynicism, detachment, and feelings of ineffectiveness and lack of accomplishment." 

Without having the proper support, teachers are in danger of being overworked and not taking care of their own mental and physical health needs. That is why Better Help is stepping in to support. 

Better Help is an online counseling platform with a mission of "Making professional therapy accessible, affordable, and convenient". The team at Better Health is creating the Educator Alliance Initiative which will supply their counseling to educators for free in hopes to help reduce the overall teacher burnout rate in the education system. 

Once this initiative goes live, the organization is expecting a mass influx in inquires. Those in the inquiry intake department will need to be able to quickly and effectively determine if that person is a candidate for the Educator Alliance Initiative. Better Help has enlisted my assistance in building a model that will be able to read any incoming inquery and predict whether or not to place that person into their new initiative with at least 90% accuracy.
